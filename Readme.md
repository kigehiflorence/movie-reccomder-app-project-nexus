#  Movie Recommendation System



This project is a simple movie recommendation system that leverages various technologies to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. The system is built using a combination of MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React, and Django, incorporating several machine learning techniques and libraries.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store movie data efficiently.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API endpoints.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to implement the machine learning model.

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap**: A popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React applications.
- **Font Awesome**: A toolkit for icons and social logos.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

### Machine Learning
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations in Python.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python, used for implementing the recommendation algorithm.
- **PorterStemmer**: An algorithm for removing common morphological and inflexional endings from words in English.
- **CountVectorizer**: A tool from Scikit-learn used to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
- **Cosine Similarity**: A metric used to measure how similar two data points are irrespective of their size.

## Project Structure

### Backend
- **server.js**: The main entry point of the backend application.
- **models/Movie.js**: The Mongoose schema for the Movie collection.

### Frontend
- **src/index.js**: The main entry point of the React application.
- **src/App.js**: The main component that includes routing and layout.
- **src/components/Navbar.js**: A navigation bar component.

### Machine Learning
- **ml/recommendation.py**: Python script containing the recommendation logic using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- **ml/config.py**: Configuration file containing movie data and similarity matrices.

## How It Works

### Data Preparation
Movie data is stored in MongoDB. The data includes movie titles, genres, descriptions, and other relevant information.

### Machine Learning Model
A content-based filtering model is implemented using Scikit-learn. The model uses `CountVectorizer` to convert movie descriptions into a matrix of token counts, and `Cosine Similarity` to compute the similarity between movies.

### API Endpoints
The Express server exposes API endpoints to fetch movie data and recommendations. These endpoints interact with the MongoDB database and the Django machine learning model.

### Frontend
The React application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation system. Users can search for movies and get personalized recommendations.

## Workflow

Here is an overview of how the system works:

1. **User Input**:
   - The user inputs a movie name in the React frontend.
   
2. **Frontend Request**:
   - The React app sends a POST request to the **Express server**, passing the movie name.
   
3. **Movie Data Fetch**:
   - The Express server queries **MongoDB** to fetch relevant movie data.
   
4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Express sends the movie ID to **Django**, which uses a content-based filtering model to get similar movies.
   
5. **Recommendation**:
   - Django sends the recommended movie IDs back to Express, which then queries MongoDB for the details of those recommended movies.
   
6. **Display Results**:
   - Express sends the recommended movies back to React, which displays them to the user.
